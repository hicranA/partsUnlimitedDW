## Background information

This topic was inspired by "The Unicorn Project," which describes the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation in a large organization. Specifically, I plan to focus on storing and analyzing data related to charging stations, EV product price lists, EV car information, and EV customer data, such as their geographic location, the model of the car they own, and location data.In this scnerio Parts Unlimited already sells EV parts, and my goal is to improve the organization's data management, reporting, and analysis capabilities related to this business.
